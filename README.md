 # Common Algorithms in JavaScript 


#### What's an algorithm?

of Professor David J. Malan explains how algorithms can be used in seemingly 
simple situations and also complex ones. 

#### List of common algorithms
 
* [Fizz Buzz](src/fizzbuzz.js)

Fizz-Buzz is a group word game for children to teach them about division. 
Players take turns to count incrementally, replacing any multiple of three 
with the word "fizz", and any multiple of five with the word "buzz".
   
* [Two Sum](src/TwoSum.js)

You are given an array of n integers and a number k. Determine whether there is a pair
of elements in the array that sums to exactly k. For example, given the array [1, 3, 7] and
k = 8, the answer is "yes" but given k = 6 the answer is "no"

* [Harmless Ransom Note](src/HarmlessRansomNote.js)

The harmless ransom note is simply a note made of words cut out from a magazine text.

You have been given two strings. You have to find out whether you can make up the 
first string with the words present in the second string.

* [Is Palindrome](src/IsPalindrome.js)

A palindrome is a word, phrase, number or sequence of words that reads the same backward 
as forward. Punctuation and spaces between the words or lettering is allowed. 

* [Caesar Cipher](src/CaesarCipher.js)

Caesar cipher is to replace each plaintext letter with a different one a fixed number of 
places down the alphabet. The cipher illustrated here uses a left shift of three, so that 
(for example) each occurrence of E in the plaintext becomes B in the ciphertext.

* [Reverse Words](src/ReverseWords.js)

Reverse the string without using array.prototype.reverse().

* [Reverse Array In Place](src/ReverseArrayInPlace.js)

Reverse the order of the elements of an array. 

* [Mean Median Mode](src/MeanMedianMode.js)

Calculate the mean, median, or mode of a data set!

* [Fibonacci](src/Fibonacci.js)

The Fibonacci Sequence is the series of numbers: 0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, . . . 
Each subsequent number is the sum of the previous two.

Write a function to return an n element in Fibonacci sequence

* [Sieve of Eratosthenes](src/SieveOfEratosthenes.js)

In mathematics, the sieve of Eratosthenes is an ancient algorithm for finding all prime 
numbers up to any given limit. It does so by iteratively marking as composite (i.e., 
not prime) the multiples of each prime, starting with the first prime number, 2.

Given a number n, print all primes smaller than or equal to n. It is also given that n 
is a small number.

* [Max Stock Profit](src/MaxStockProfit.js)

Given an array of stock prices over time, need to figure out the best buy and sell price 
so that we get the maximum profit. The selling should occur after buying of the stock.
 

* Plurality (winner take all) 

In the plurality vote, every voter gets to vote for one candidate. At the end 
of the election, whichever candidate has the greatest number of votes is 
declared the winner of the election.

* Runoff

In a ranked-choice system, voters can vote for more than one candidate. Instead 
of just voting for their top choice, they can rank the candidates in order of 
preference. 

* Readability
* Liner Search
* Binary Search
* Bubble Sort
* Selection Sort
* Insertion Sort
* Recursion
* Merge Sort
